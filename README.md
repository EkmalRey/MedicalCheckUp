This Program Is Built According To This:

**Description :**  The application is used to manage data of patients who do medical check up. The data processed is data
service packages as well as patient data that performs medical check up. Application users are hospital officers or
laboratory.

**Specification :**
- Users can add, change (edit), and delete service packages, patient data, recap of medical checkup results.
- Users can display income reports from medical check up services on a certain period.
- Users can search list of patient who choose a particular package, list of patient who did medical check up on a certain period, and search for patient by name.
- Users can display patient data sorted by medical check up time or service packages.

There are also some general specification for this project such as:
- Implement the use of array and type structs. Static array only, no dynamic array or slice.
- Implement the use of Sequential search and Binary search on the process of searching, editing, or deleting particular data.
- Implement the use of Selection sort and Insertion sort algorithm to sort certain data with different category when displaying data. Every category needs to be able to be sorted Ascending and Descending.
- It is not allowed to use Break statements (other than for a repeat-until loop) or continue.
- The use of global variables are only allowed on certain array that will be processed.
