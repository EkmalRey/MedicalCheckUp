## 🎯 **What This Project Shows**

This is my Final Project Of The Course Programming Algorithm project that demonstrates my understanding of:
- **Data structures** (arrays, structs)
- **Search algorithms** (binary search, sequential search)
- **Sorting algorithms** (selection sort, insertion sort)
- **File I/O and JSON handling**
- **User interface design** for CLI applications
- **Input validation and error handling**

### **The Problem**
Create a simple system to manage medical check-up data including patients, medical packages, and records.

### **My Solution**
A menu-driven CLI program that handles basic CRUD operations with data persistence and some nice quality-of-life features.

## ⚡ **Features Implemented**

### 👥 **Patient Management**
- Add, view, edit, and delete patients
- Search by name or ID
- Sort by name, age, or ID
- Basic input validation

### 📦 **Package Management**
- Manage medical packages with categories and pricing
- Search and filter options
- CRUD operations with validation

### 📋 **Medical Records**
- Link patients with packages and dates
- Date validation (including leap years)
- Search by various criteria
- Basic record management

### 📊 **Simple Reports**
- Patient statistics (age, gender distribution)
- Package analytics
- Revenue tracking
- Basic data summaries

## 🛠️ **Technical Stuff**

### **What I Used**
- **Language**: Go (learning project)
- **Data Storage**: JSON files
- **Data Structures**: Arrays and structs
- **Algorithms**: Binary search, selection sort, insertion sort
- **Interface**: CLI with colored output

### **Programming Concepts Applied**
- ✅ **Struct definitions** and data organization
- ✅ **Function design** and modular programming
- ✅ **Input validation** and error handling
- ✅ **File I/O** with JSON serialization
- ✅ **Search algorithms** (O(log n) binary search)
- ✅ **Sorting algorithms** (selection and insertion sort)

### **Code Example**
```go
// Binary search implementation for patient lookup
func binarySearchPatientByID(id int) int {
    left, right := 0, patients.N-1
    for left <= right {
        mid := (left + right) / 2
        if patients.Daftar[mid].ID == id {
            return mid
        } else if patients.Daftar[mid].ID < id {
            left = mid + 1
        } else {
            right = mid - 1
        }
    }
    return -1
}
```

## 🚀 **How to Run It**

### **You'll Need**
- Go installed on your computer ([Get it here](https://golang.org/dl/))
- Any terminal/command prompt

### **Running the Program**
```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd MedicalCheckUp

# Run the main program
go run main_optimized.go

# Or build an executable
go build -o medical.exe main_optimized.go
./medical.exe
```

### **What You Can Do**
1. Start the program and follow the menus
2. Add some patients and packages first
3. Create medical records linking them together
4. Try the search and sorting features
5. Check out the reports section
6. Data saves automatically when you exit

## � **For Recruiters**

This project shows I can:
- **Write clean, functional Go code** with proper structure
- **Implement basic algorithms** (binary search, sorting)
- **Handle user input and validation** effectively
- **Work with JSON data** and file persistence
- **Create user-friendly interfaces** even for CLI applications
- **Organize code** into logical, maintainable functions
- **Add testing** and documentation to projects

It's a solid demonstration of fundamental programming skills and problem-solving approach using Go.

## 🧪 **Testing**

The project includes a test suite in the `tests/` folder. You can run it to see the code quality and functionality:

```bash
cd tests
go run test_functionality.go
```
